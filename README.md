#### Cards is full-fledged frontend app, developed in a team, with full authentication cycle.

Cards uses [spaced repetition technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) for you to quickly memorize things.
In the app, you can create packs of cards, fill them with cards with text or pictures, learn them, as well as search and study packs of other users.
